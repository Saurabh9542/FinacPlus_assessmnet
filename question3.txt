When I worked at Amazon, the metadata information that was kept in the database for a product would usually contain a range of specifics that were used to classify and characterise the item. The following is an inventory of typical metadata that could be kept for a shirt:

1. Product ID: The shirt's exclusive identification number.
2. Title/Name: The shirt's name.
3. Description: A thorough explanation of the shirt's features, such as its material, size, colour, and style.
4. Brand: The shirt's brand.
5. Category/Department: The department or category (such as Men's Clothing, Women's Clothing, etc.) to which the shirt belongs.
6. Cost: The shirt's price.
7. Availability: The state in which the shirt is available for purchase.
8. photos: Links or references to the shirt's photos.
9. Size: The shirt's available sizes.
10. Colour: The shirt's available colours.
11. Material: The shirt's material makeup.
12. Style/Pattern: The shirt's design or pattern (solid, striped, floral, etc.).
13. Fit: The shirt's style of fit (such as slim fit or standard fit).
14. Care Instructions: Advice about how to take care of the shirt, such as machine washing or only dry cleaning.
15. Weight: How much the shirt weighs.
16. Dimensions: The shirt's measurements, such as its length, width, and height.
17. shipment Details: Details on dimensions, weight, and shipment options for computations of shipping.
18. Customer Reviews and Ratings: These are the opinions and ratings left by people who have bought the shirt.
19. connected Products: Product links that are suggested or connected.
Twenty. Tags/Keywords: Tags or keywords related to the shirt for filtering and search functions.

This metadata can be used in a number of ways after it has been stored, such as:

1. Search and Discovery: Customers can look for shirts by brand, size, colour, style, and other criteria.
2. Filtering and Sorting: Based on various parameters, users can filter and sort search results.
3. Recommendations: By utilising the metadata, customers can receive customised product recommendations based on their prior behaviour and preferences.
4. Inventory Management: To make sure that products are refilled as needed, inventory management can make use of the availability and stock information.
5. Analytics and Insights: Metadata analysis can reveal information about trends, popular styles, and client preferences, which can help guide corporate choices.
6. Marketing and Advertising: Based on the interests and preferences of particular client categories, metadata can be used to tailor promotions and adverts to them.

All things considered, each item's information is vital to the efficient management of products, customer service, and company operations on Amazon's platform.
